# Bike Demand: Week 1 starter

Teams of 3–4 use one private GitHub repository throughout the course. Lab 1 is
repository setup, Git workflow and quality checks. Lab 2 adds validated data,
chronological splitting, a baseline comparison and local MLflow tracking.
No Docker, cloud account or MLflow server is needed this week.

## Setup: Lab 1

Install Git and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
(`>=0.12.19,<0.13`). Python **3.12** is required; uv can download it. From the
`bike-demand/` root:

```bash
uv python install 3.12
uv sync --locked
uv run --locked python -m bike_demand.preflight
uv run --locked ruff check .
uv run --locked ruff format --check .
uv run --locked pytest -q -m infra
uv run --locked pytest -q -m lab1
```

First setup requires internet for Python and the locked dependencies, unless
these exact distributions are already cached. The frozen UCI CSV ships here;
preflight does not download/repair it. `uv.lock` is shared across platforms;
that is not evidence that every OS has been tested. macOS setup has been checked;
Windows and Linux remain unverified. Remote CI is unavailable until a permitted
repository is configured and a workflow actually runs on the checked revision.
Do not regenerate the lock just to bypass an installation failure.

## Expected failure and exercise: Lab 1

`pytest -m infra` must pass immediately. `pytest -m lab1` has **one intentional
behavior failure** in `src/bike_demand/team.py`: the helper
`normalize_team_slug` does not yet meet the contract in `tests/lab1/test_team.py`
(trim, lowercase, join whitespace with hyphens, reject blank names with
`ValueError`). Read the assertion, diagnose the cause, make a small repair and add
one useful test of your own. Do not weaken assertions, skip tests or disable
checks. Sync or import errors, or failures outside `lab1`, are setup problems:
diagnose them separately.

Fill in `WORKING-AGREEMENT.md`. Use a task branch, open a pull request, and get a
review from another member before merging. Rotate driver/reviewer roles and the
main PR author between labs. Keep actual evidence in `reports/lab-01.md` and
`reports/week-01-team.md`; templates contain no pre-filled results.

## Expected failures: Lab 2

The student export has bounded TODOs in `src/bike_demand/`:

| File | Your task |
| --- | --- |
| `validate.py` | Categorical domains, finite normalised ranges, nonnegative counts, date windows |
| `split.py` | Chronological nonempty/disjoint/complete partitions; sort `(dteday, hr, instant)` |
| `train.py` | Ordered predictors, train-mean comparator, RF fit and validation MAE |

`NotImplementedError("TODO(Week 1, Lab 2): ...")` and failing exercise tests are
**expected before implementation**, not environment failures. Infra must pass
immediately. Do not skip/mute exercise tests or fabricate metrics to get green.
Tracking, metadata/history, configuration and input parsing are already supplied.
Read the failing test, inspect the contract, implement one TODO, and rerun:

```bash
uv run --locked pytest -q -m exercise
uv run --locked python -m bike_demand.validate --data data/raw/hour.csv
uv run --locked python -m bike_demand.train --config configs/baseline.yaml
uv run --locked pytest -q
```

Keep `data/raw/hour.csv` unchanged; use copies and `tests/fixtures/` for deliberate
faults. `missing-temp.csv` is the worked Fault A; design your own Fault B by
breaking exactly one contract rule or split boundary on a tiny copy, with a valid
control and a test of your own. The supplied `hum-out-of-range.csv` is another
worked example, not your Fault B. Missing hours are valid. Features and splits are fixed in the config and
code. Fit only on 2011 training rows; compare both predictors on the same
2012 January–June validation rows. Hold July–December 2012 test rows throughout
Weeks 1–4; do not compute test metrics. MAE is rentals/hour, not accuracy, and
RF is not required to beat the comparator. The task uses supplied weather;
it does not forecast future weather or station-level demand.

## Outputs and readback

Each successful train execution creates two separate MLflow runs, a saved
`artifacts/model.joblib` and `model-metadata.json`, latest `reports/metrics.json`,
and one appended `reports/metrics-history.jsonl` line. Metadata records feature
order, data identity, model version and run ID. A commit is recorded when Git is
available; `working_tree_dirty` prevents uncommitted code being mistaken for a
committed revision. Train reloads the trusted local model and verifies validation
MAE/metadata and logged artifact bytes. Never load untrusted joblib files.
Optional stretch, only after the core is complete and reviewed: run train again
unchanged and compare both run IDs and observed MAEs/history. Do not promise
byte-identical models across systems/library versions.

Viewer is optional; training does not depend on it:

```bash
uv run --locked mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///tracking/mlflow.db --default-artifact-root tracking/artifacts --no-serve-artifacts --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000 --workers 1
```

`artifacts/`, `tracking/` and `.venv/` are ignored by Git. Team metrics may be
committed as evidence; never commit credentials or individual private reports.
CI currently checks only infrastructure/quality; expand it in Week 3.

## Support and individual reports

If setup remains blocked after five minutes, contact the instructor using the
support route recorded in your working agreement. Do not spend the whole lab
repairing a laptop. Ask for an approved recovery function only if coding remains
blocked; acknowledge the supplied code and assistance in your report. Recovery
is instructor-controlled, not bundled here.

## Names, reports and screenshots

Repository names (lowercase, hyphens, the same for the whole course):

- Team repository: `mlops-<session>-<team-name>-bike-demand`, for example
  `mlops-thu1-sparrows-bike-demand`. Sessions: `thu1`, `thu2`, `fri1`, `fri2`
  (1 = morning, 2 = afternoon).
- Your private report repository: `mlops-<session>-<github-username>`, for example
  `mlops-thu1-minhtc`. You create it and invite the instructor (`minhtc-uca`). Start from the
  [report template](../report-template/README.md) and commit to `main`; no report
  pull request or CI is used.

Reports mix writing and images. Save screenshots in `reports/images/` and embed
them in the report (see the template). A screenshot supports, but does not replace,
the command, revision and your explanation. Never show tokens, passwords or
personal data. Team evidence goes in `reports/lab-01.md` and
`reports/week-01-team.md`, with team screenshots in `reports/images/`.
Each weekly report is due Sunday 23:59 of the same week (published time zone).
Assessment policy comes from the instructor, not this repository.
See `BACKLOG.md` for later labs.
